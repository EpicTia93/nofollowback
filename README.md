# See who doesn't follow you back on Instagram.
This script based on the .json data files provided by Instagram creates a file called noback.txt that gives you the list of all the people who don't follow you back.

## Set up
First of all create a new directory and place inside that directory the **main.py script** and the files provided in the data JSON files downloaded from Instagram which can be found inside the folder _"followers_and_following"_ renamed to **following.json** and **followers.json**.

## Usage and Output
Navigate to the script directory and run: <pre> python3 main.py </pre>
The script will create two outputs: _following.txt_ and _followers.txt_ files which you consult to get a .txt following or followers list and then the most important output which is the **noback.txt that contains all the usernames of the people that don't follow you back.**
